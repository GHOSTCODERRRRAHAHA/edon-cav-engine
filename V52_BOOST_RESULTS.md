# V5.2 Predicted Boost Incremental Results

## Current Progress

| Test | Config | Mean | Std | Seeds | Status |
|------|--------|------|-----|-------|--------|
| 1 | Boost 0.15, Scale 1.5 | -2.1% | ±2.1% | 3/3 | ❌ Negative |
| 2 | Boost 0.20, Scale 2.0 (V5.2) | -0.0% | ±0.0% | 1/3 | ⏳ Running |
| 3 | Boost 0.25, Scale 2.5 | [Running...] | | | ⏳ |
| 4 | Boost 0.20, Scale 1.5 | [Running...] | | | ⏳ |
| 5 | Boost 0.20, Scale 2.0, Cap 0.6 | [Running...] | | | ⏳ |

## Early Analysis

**Test 1** (very conservative, 7.5% max boost):
- **Result**: -2.1% ± 2.1% (negative)
- **Conclusion**: Too conservative, not helping

**Test 2** (current V5.2, 10% max boost):
- **Progress**: 1/3 seeds, -0.0% so far
- **Status**: Neutral, need more seeds

## Observations

- Very conservative boost (Test 1) is worse
- Need to find sweet spot between too little and too much
- Current V5.2 (Test 2) showing neutral so far

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Wait for all tests to complete
2. ⏳ Compare all configurations
3. ⏳ Select best (most positive, in +1% to +3% range)
4. ⏳ If none positive → may need different approach
