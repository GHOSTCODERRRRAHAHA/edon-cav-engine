# Roadmap to 20% Improvement

## Current Status

- **Best result**: V5.1 (LPF only) = **+0.2%** (high_stress, 3 seeds)
- **Target**: **20%**
- **Gap**: **19.8 percentage points**
- **Progress**: **1% of target**

## Milestone Breakdown

| Stage | Target Range | Current | Gap | Multiplier |
|-------|--------------|---------|-----|------------|
| **Stage 0** | +1% to +3% | +0.2% | 0.8-2.8% | 5-15x |
| **Stage 1** | +5% to +10% | +0.2% | 4.8-9.8% | 25-50x |
| **Stage 2** | +10% to +15% | +0.2% | 9.8-14.8% | 50-75x |
| **Stage 3** | +15% to +20% | +0.2% | 14.8-19.8% | 75-100x |

## What's Needed for Each Stage

### Stage 0: +1% to +3% (Current Focus)
**What we're trying now:**
- ✅ LPF working (+0.2%)
- ⏳ Predicted boost (testing, not helping yet)
- ⏳ PREFALL scaling (next step)
- ⏳ Better state mapping

**Likely needs:**
- Fine-tune LPF alpha
- Better predicted instability source
- Optimize PREFALL range
- Improve SAFE trigger

### Stage 1: +5% to +10%
**Likely needs:**
- Better correction algorithms
- More sophisticated state awareness
- Better integration with baseline
- Improved prediction accuracy

### Stage 2: +10% to +15%
**Likely needs:**
- Advanced control strategies
- Multi-layer corrections
- Better disturbance handling
- Predictive control

### Stage 3: +15% to +20%
**Likely needs:**
- Fundamental architectural improvements
- Advanced state estimation
- Optimal control integration
- Machine learning enhancements

## Realistic Timeline

- **Stage 0**: Current focus, achievable with current approach
- **Stage 1**: Requires significant improvements
- **Stage 2**: Requires architectural changes
- **Stage 3**: Requires fundamental redesign

## Recommendation

**Focus on Stage 0 first** (+1% to +3%):
1. Get LPF + predicted boost working
2. Optimize PREFALL scaling
3. Improve state mapping
4. Once Stage 0 achieved, then push to Stage 1

**20% is achievable, but we need to walk before we run.**
